Input files for the colorplane program. These inputs were used to generate the results in the plane_coloring paper. After compiling the code, you may test running the code by simplu issuing 

colorplane < input.inp

You perhaps want to start from some of the smaller computations...

The naming of the files is as follows: for example the file "q2-10-1.inp" starts the somputation for two colors, lattice size 10 x 10 unit areas, and first lattice constant value, which for the paper was 0.1.

There is a rough rule that halving the lattice constant while keeping the area constant increases the computation time tenfold.
